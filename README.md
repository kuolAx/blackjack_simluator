Rules:
-
-> the deck contains of 6 x 52 standard card decks  
-> the deck is reshuffled after every hand to make card counting unprofitable  
-> the format used is "placeholder for ruleset"  
-> using only numbers to identify the card value, since suits do not matter in blackjack  


possible implementation goals:
-
-> ace being 1 or 11 points logic  
-> usage of actual cards to make splitting possible
-> splitting and doubling your bets
